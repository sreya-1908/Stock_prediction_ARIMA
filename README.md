## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA for forecasting stock prices. ARIMA is a powerful tool for time series prediction, commonly used in finance and economics. Using historical stock data, this model predicts future stock values by analyzing patterns in past data.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the sample stock data (e.g., `stock_data.csv`).
- `src/`: Includes the ARIMA forecasting code.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage instructions.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sreya-1908/Stock_prediction_ARIMA/tree/main

## Results
The model will output the forecasted values for a specified number of days. These results are visualized in a time series plot, comparing historical and predicted stock prices.

## Usage
1. **Prepare the data**: Place your historical stock data in the `data/` folder, ensuring it has a `Date` column and a `Price` column.

2. **Run the analysis**: In your Python script or Jupyter notebook, you can import the forecasting function and call it as follows:

   ```python
   from src.forecast import fit_arima_and_forecast

   # Customize the file path and forecasting steps
   model_fit, forecasted_values = fit_arima_and_forecast('data/stock_data.csv', forecast_steps=30)

  3. **Visualize the forecast**: The code will generate a plot showing historical and forecasted stock prices.
